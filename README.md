# CellSegment
This is an user interface for a voronoi diagram representation of cell segmentation.
After compiling the code, you can input the cell image. 
Key "Tab" can change the selected cell center.
You can use the keys up, down, left, right to tune the position of the seleted center.
By tuning the selected center, the algorithm compute new voronoi diagram.

Key "q" will kill the program
