# CellSegment
This is an user interface for a voronoi diagram representation of cell segmentation.
After compiling the code, you can input the cell image. 
Key "Tab" can change the selected cell center.
You can use the keys 'w' for up, 's' for down, 'a' for left, 'd' for right to tune the position of the seleted center.
By tuning the selected center, the algorithm compute new voronoi diagram.
The track bar can change the width of the diagram.

Key "q" will kill the program
